# mySQL-SQL-Project-PART1

PART1: This involved the use of MySQL to create a relational database for a local car rental company (HW motors) to enable them manage the renting of their different vehicles to the public. Where the database is design using both an Entity–Relationship Diagram(ERD)(used UML), as well as a Relational Schema(RS) and capable of storing and accounting for fixed rental price per day, % increase in price due to peak time demand and % discounts rewarded to bookings lasting 7 days or longer. Along with other relevant information for renting a car, such as booking duration, customers personal detail, insurance extras and vehicle details (e.g. cost, number of seats, engine size, transmission type).

This database’s design necessitated the creation of an Entity–Relationship Diagram(ERD)(using UML) and a Relational Schema(RS). ERD features utilised included; relationships(one-to-many, many-to-many, recursive), attributes(derived, repeating, composite) and composite keys, as well as generalisation and specialisation.
